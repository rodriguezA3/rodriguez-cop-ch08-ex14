/* ch08 ex14
Can we declare a non-reference function argument const?
e.g. void f(const int)
What might that mean? Why might we want to do that?
Why don’t people do that often? 
Try it; write a couple of small programs to see what works.
idea: the year people were born in is a constant value, a function
may use a year value as parameter, and print some modification of
that year, e.g. "in what year were they 21 years old"
